Do you have any feedback for the selection process? 
           Honestly, i knew abt the club already
           But i thought you guys would select when the college opens
           I was lately inducted (nov10) so i didnt knew abt the club registeration untill 27th nov
           So i think if you had reach out to the newly inducted member it would have been helpfull
           But its okay.. 
 
THANK YOY
